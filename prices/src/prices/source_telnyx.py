"""Pull Telnyx Inference pricing from Telnyx's public pricing API.

Telnyx publishes rates at ``GET https://api.telnyx.com/v2/pricing/products/{slug}``, unauthenticated.
This reads the ``inference`` product and appends the models it can represent to
``prices/providers/telnyx.yml``.

Two things about that API drive the design of this module.

1. **Two products matter, and both need explicit paging.** ``inference`` carries the LLMs;
   ``voice-api`` carries text-to-speech and speech-to-text. Every endpoint here, including the
   product list itself, defaults to 20 items per page and silently ignores ``page_size``: the
   parameter is ``page[size]``. Reading the product list without it returns 20 of 33 products and
   hides ``voice-api`` entirely, which is exactly how this module first concluded, wrongly, that
   Telnyx published no voice pricing.

2. **The headline rate is not always the price.** Ten of the eighteen inference models report
   ``input_rate: "0.00"`` while their tier list prices the same dimension above 1,000,000 units.
   The API documents tiers as "volume-based" but does not say what the volume is measured over, and
   does not define how ``input_rate`` relates to ``input_tiers`` when they disagree. Publishing
   ``$0`` for those models would say a paid model is free, so they are refused rather than guessed
   at, and named in the report.

The two products are handled differently on purpose. Inference rows carry a machine ``model`` id, so
they can be imported automatically. Voice rows carry only a prose ``name`` ("Call Control Features
In-House HD Text-To-Speech - per character") and no id at all, so they cannot be mapped without a
curated table; those are drift-checked against the models this catalog already publishes, never
auto-added.

Only models whose every tier agrees with the headline rate are imported. Those land unverified
(``provenance.source = imported``, no ``prices_checked``), because a human sets the verified date.
