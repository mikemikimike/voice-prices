"""The LiveKit plugin registry has to stay joinable to the catalog.

The coverage page is only worth reading if the join underneath it is sound, and every way it can
rot is silent: a provider gets renamed and a covered plugin quietly reads as a gap, a hand-edit
drops a `provides` list and the denominator shrinks, a skip reason gets a status nobody renders.
None of that fails a normal build, so it is pinned here instead.
